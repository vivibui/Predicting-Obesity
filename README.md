### Team 2: Aishwarya Kotha, Sofia Qian, Vivian Bui, Nikita Mathur, Yijie Lian


#### Description of Project:
Obesity is a growing problem worldwide, and it is important to examine the obesity levels of people to determine how to best remedy this global issue. The World Health Organization states that the fundamental cause of obesity is an energy imabalance between calories consumed and calories expended. Therefore, we will examine how people's eating and behavioral habits will affect their obesity levels as determined by mass body index in this study. Our study focuses on data collected from Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. 

#### Goals:
- Predict obesity level based on various environmental and behavioral factors.
- Determine which factors are more or less present in individuals with obesity.
- Determine which factors are more or less present in individuals without obesity.

#### Data Information:
The data documents various food and beverage consumption factors that could impact a person's risk of being obese. These are listed as various columns, as follows:
- FAVC: frequent consumption of high caloric food
- FCVC: frequency of consumption of vegetables
- NCP: number of main meals
- CAEC: consumption of food between meals
- CH20: consumption of water daily
- CALC: consumption of alcohol
The data also documents attributes that can determine physical health and condition, as follows:
- SCC: calories consumption monitoring
- FAF: physical activity frequency
- TUE: time using technology devices
- MTRANS: transportation used
This dataset also includes individual variables such as gender, age, height, and weight. Each individual was also assigned an "obesity" variable, with values as follows:
- Insufficient Weight
- Normal Weight
- Overweight Level I
- Overweight Level II
- Obesity Type I
- Obesity Type II
- Obesity Type III
These groupings were determined by values using the following equation: Mass Body Index = Weight/(height*height), which were then compared with information from the WHO and Mexican Normativity.
